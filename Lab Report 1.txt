\section{Familiarize - Part 1 Summary}
 \paragraph{}    	I was unable to read through the information at the link because of the link's failure. So, I didn't understand what the optional interactive tour was. But, my lab TA was kind enough to send me the updated link. It allowed me to view the Spyder Documentation page where quick start, installation, troubleshooting, FAQs, and more in-depth information was present. I decided not to follow the interactive tour because I've worked with software similar to Spyder in the past. I read over the Spyder keyboard shortcuts, and was relieved to see that many of them are similar to the ones I already know. Finally, I opened a file in Spyder and named it properly. 
\section{Python - Part 2 Summary}
 \paragraph{}     	I learned how to print strings and variables, square a variable, and why we prefer the numpy arrays and their flexible indexing over lists. Another useful skill is the importing of a module 'as' something else for more concise naming. From here I walked through commenting for documentation, array creation with numpy, and accessing the entire column/row of a numpy array. More important functionality involved using numpy functions to fill arrays with all zeros or ones. I was also taught about plotting subplots and traces. \\
\paragraph{}    	Next up on the agenda was complex numbers. We use 'j' instead if i, Anaconda prints them out in rectangular form, and there are useful functions for them under 'numpy'. Finally, I became familiarized with the different modules and functions we'll use throughout the semester.  
\section{Pep8 - Part 3 Summary}
 \paragraph{}   	It told us that we use 4  spaces for indentation, tabs are used for if-else statements and function definition. We then explored docstrings, wrapping lines, comment syntax, space placement, and naming conventions. 
\section{Latex - Part 4 Summary}
 \paragraph{}   	The above three sections concerned Python in Spyder, but this one is about Latex. The Latex cheat sheets provided a concise introduction to syntax and functionality of Latex. I then looked at templates and decided to use the sample lab report latex code as a basis for all future lab reports done in this class.    

%\section{Personal Notes}

%To run anaconda: open 'anaconda prompt', type 'spyder' 

%Spyder only saves stuff everytime something is run (WRONG)
% - Spyder will only run a file once it's saved

%Introduced syntax for complex numbers in Python, using numpy

\section{Questions}

1. Which course are you most excited for in your degree? Which course have you enjoyed the
most so far?\\
\paragraph{}   I'm most excited for ECE443, Embedded Systems. I really enjoyed ECE340, Microcontrollers, so I'm hoping to learn more about related material. So far, I've enjoyed Microcontrollers the most.\\

2. Leave any feedback on the clarity of the expectations, instructions, and deliverables.\\
\paragraph{}    It was a bit confusing going through the Python instructional portion of this lab report. I was unsure as to whether we were supposed to code up all the Python commands given to us ourselves, or whether we were just supposed to read through it. Just in-case, I included the python part 2 and 3 code in my GitHub. \\
