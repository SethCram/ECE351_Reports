    \begin{equation*}
        H(s) = V_{out}(s)/V_{in}(s) = Ls/(Ls + R(1 + LCs^2)
    \end{equation*}
    
    \begin{equation*}
        h(t) = 10,000 \cdot e^{-5000t} \cdot ( cos(18,584t) - 0.269sin(18,584t) )
        %h(t) = 0.02796 \cdot e^{-5000t} \cdot sin(18,584.12t + 105.06 ^{\circ} ) \cdot u(t)
    \end{equation*}

    The work gone through to find these two equations is detailed on the following pages.

    \paragraph{} As seen above, there isn't very much work shown for solving h(t) because I plugged H(s) into an inverse laplace function within my calculator.
