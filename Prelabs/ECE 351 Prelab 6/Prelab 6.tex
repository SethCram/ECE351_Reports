 1. By hand, find the transfer function. Assume all initial conditions are zero. \\
    \begin{equation*}
        H(s) = Y(s)/X(s) = (s^2+6s+12)/((s+4)(s+6))
    \end{equation*}

2. For the system H(s), find y(t) for a step input using partial fraction expansion and inverse
Laplace transforms.
    \begin{equation*}
        y(t) = (0.5 - 0.5 \cdot e^{-4t} + e^{-6t}) \cdot u(t)
    \end{equation*}

    The work gone through to find these two equations is detailed on the following pages.

    \paragraph{} We can see above how I derived the equations shown on page 1.
